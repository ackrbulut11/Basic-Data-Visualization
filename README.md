1. *I used the Netflix dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/data). After dropping the data that wasn't useful to me, I created simple visualizations with Matplotlib to show the ratio of TV shows to movies and the release years of content on Netflix.*

2. *I used Data Science Salary dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023). First of all, i made some data better readable. Then I compared to relationship between salary and experience level. I examined the correlation between the size of a company and the salaries offered. Subsequently, I tried to analyze the relationship between salary and location. Finally I worked with job titles and their relations with number of employee and salary.*

3. *I used Football Manager 2023 Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/platinum22/foot-ball-manager-2023-dataset). Firstly, some columns have been renamed. Then I analyzed and grouped some data (like u21 players, penalty takers, top players etc.). Later I tried to make some visualisations with the help of these data.*
