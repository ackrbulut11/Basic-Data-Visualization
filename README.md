# Basic-Data-Visualization

*I used the Netflix dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/data). After dropping the data that wasn't useful to me, I created simple visualizations with Matplotlib to show the ratio of TV shows to movies and the release years of content on Netflix.*
